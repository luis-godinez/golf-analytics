## Acknowledgments

This project is inspired by [Golf Shot Analytics](https://www.golfshotanalytics.com/), a now-defunct tool that provided in-depth analysis of golf shot data. While the original app does not run on macOS, lacks support for Garmin R50, and is no longer maintained, it served as a conceptual starting point for this project.
